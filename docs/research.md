## Research Areas

My research interests lie primarily in the fields of _supply chain management_ and _data science_ spanning **decision analytics** and **mathematical optimization** problems. 

### Supply Chain Management

I work on _inventory control_ under _demand and supply uncertainty_. These decision problems are ubiquitous in **healthcare** and **humanitarian aid operations**. I have also studied various mathematical optimization problems in production and service systems, including scheduling, lot sizing, routing, and pricing.

### Data Science

My research involves combinatorial optimization approaches in numerous subdomains of data science, including **supervised learning** and **time series analysis**. In addition, I have applied some of these techniques to the toxicological evaluation of nanoparticles and interpreting EEG data.
